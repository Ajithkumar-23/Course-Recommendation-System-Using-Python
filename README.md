This Course Recommendation System is a Python-based project developed to recommend online courses using two approaches: popularity-based and content-based filtering. The system uses a dataset of Udemy courses and applies data cleaning, text preprocessing, and machine learning techniques to suggest relevant courses to users. The popularity-based recommendation system ranks courses based on a weighted score derived from the number of subscribers and reviews. On the other hand, the content-based recommendation system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to clean course titles and compute similarity between them using the CountVectorizer and cosine similarity from the scikit-learn library.

The project begins by importing essential libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, neattext for cleaning text data, and sklearn modules for vectorization and similarity calculations. The dataset is loaded and cleaned to remove missing values and duplicates, ensuring accuracy in recommendations. In the popularity-based model, each course is assigned a score computed as 60% of its subscriber count and 40% of its review count. Courses are then ranked based on this score to identify the top recommended ones.

For the content-based system, the course titles are cleaned by removing stopwords and special characters, and then combined with the course subject to enhance context. These cleaned titles are vectorized using CountVectorizer, and the resulting vectors are used to compute cosine similarity between courses. When a user selects a course, the system finds the top five most similar courses based on the similarity scores.

To make the system interactive, IPython widgets are used to create a user interface within a Jupyter Notebook. Users can select a course from a dropdown menu and click a button to view recommendations. This approach makes the recommendation experience more engaging and user-friendly. The system is ideal for platforms like Udemy, Coursera, or any educational portal that wants to personalize learning paths for its users.

Overall, this project demonstrates the use of basic NLP and machine learning techniques to build a useful and interactive course recommender system. It provides valuable insights into data preprocessing, feature extraction, and similarity measurement, making it a good learning project for beginners and intermediates interested in data science and recommendation engines.
